This project analyzed the Breast Cancer METABRIC dataset from kaggle using survival analysis methods to identify key factors influencing patient survival. Techniques such as Kaplanâ€“Meier, Cox Proportional Hazard, Random Forest, and Weibull models showed that tumor size, stage, and age significantly affect survival outcomes.
